Instructions:
Make a copy of this file in the directory for its corresponding week,replacing the [TEMPLATE]
in the title with the date in Mon.-Day format (ex: Jan-29-recap.md).
(You can also just go into Edit mode, copy the contents and paste them into a new markdown file
you make in the corresponding directory).
Remove all the template text (anything between ``` ```) and fill in with your recap.
When you're ready, submit with the commmit title:

# Class Recap: Week No. 7 - March 11, 2024
## Topic: Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)

### Summary
```

```

### Outline 
```
1. MHD Equations
  - Mass Conservation
    - $\frac{\partial \roe}{\partial \tau} + \nabla \cdot (\roe u) = 0$
    - $\roe$ is
  - Momentum Conservation
    - $\roe(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \cdot \nabla u) = -\nabla P + \overrightarrow{j} \times \overrightarrow{B}$
      - $\overrightarrow{j}$ is current density, $\overrightarrow{B}$ is magnetic field, and their cross product is the Lorentz force
  - Ohm's Law
    - $j = \sigma E'_{r}$
      - $\sigma$ is the conductivity of the medium, and $E'_{r}$ is the displacement field
      - The displacement field is the electric field in the frame of the fluid.
        - To change the frame of reference, use a Lorentzian transform, so $E' = \overrightarrow{E} + \overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{B}$
